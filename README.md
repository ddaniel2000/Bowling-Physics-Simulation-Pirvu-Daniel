"START BY PRESSING R <br />
!! DISABLE CAPS_LOCK !! <br />
"----------------------" <br />
MOVE RIGHT - -> (RIGHT ARROW) <br />
MOVE LEFT - <-(LEFT ARROW) <br />
PUSH FORWARD - UP ARROW <br />
PUSH 1 TIME WITH FORCE - G <br />
JUMP - Space <br />
RESET - R <br />
GUTTER ON - C <br />
GUTTER OFF - X <br />

Good luck to hit the pins at the end of the lane";<br />


Things that could be improved: <br />
- Finish implement Rigid Body <br />
- Add Angluar Rotation <br />
- Make the code easy to scale  <br />
- Make the code easy to read and understand <br />
- Make the code modular <br />
- Too many checks in update <br />
- Poor implemented, I could use separate classes to calculate the forces for every object, not inside of them <br />

!! Just in case, i've uploaded the same exact project as .rar on google Drive for second backup because I am aware of something may go wrong ( upload date can be checked : Apr 8, 2023 )  !!<br />
